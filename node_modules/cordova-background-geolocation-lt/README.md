Cordova Background Geolocation
===========================================================================

The *most* sophisticated background **location-tracking & geofencing** module with battery-conscious motion-detection intelligence for **iOS** and **Android**.

Also available for [React Native](https://github.com/transistorsoft/react-native-background-geolocation), [NativeScript](https://github.com/transistorsoft/nativescript-background-geolocation-lt) and pure native apps.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

:new: The **[Android plugin](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation)** requires [purchasing a license](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation).  However, it *will* work for **DEBUG** builds.  It will **not** work with **RELEASE** builds [without purchasing a license](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/cordova-background-geolocation).

## :large_blue_diamond: Configuring the plugin

The plugin requires configuration within your App's `config.xml`:

```xml
<widget id="com.your.company.app.id">
  <plugin name="cordova-background-geolocation-lt">
    <variable name="LOCATION_ALWAYS_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="Background location-tracking is required" />
    <variable name="LOCATION_WHEN_IN_USE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="Background location-tracking is required" />
    <variable name="MOTION_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="Using the accelerometer increases battery-efficiency by intelligently toggling location-tracking only when the device is detected to be moving" />
    <!-- Android only -->
    <variable name="LICENSE" value="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" />
  </plugin>
  .
  .
  .
</widget>
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

:warning: To apply changes to these `<variable />`, you **must** remove/re-add the plugin (**append `--nosave` when removing the plugin**)

```
$ cordova plugin remove cordova-background-geolocation-lt --nosave
$ cordova plugin add cordova-background-geolocation-lt
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### :large_blue_diamond: Disabling Background "location"

For those using `useSignificantChangesOnly: true`, possibly because Apple *denied* your use of the background `location` capability, you can disable background `location` by providing the `BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION` `<variable />` with an empty-string:

```xml
<plugin name="cordova-background-geolocation-lt">
  .
  .
  .
  <!-- Disable background "location" capability with empty-string -->
  <variable name="BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION" value="" />
</plugin>
```

##### `@variable LICENSE [""]` Android
**[Android]** Your Android license key generated from [Product Dashboard](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/customers)

##### `@variable LOCATION_ALWAYS_AND_WHEN_IN_USE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION ["Background location-tracking is required"]` iOS

**[iOS 11+]** Customize the message displayed to the user when `AlwaysAndWhenInUse` location authorization is requested.  This variable is added to your iOS `.plist` in the `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` key.

##### `@variable LOCATION_ALWAYS_USAGE_DESCRIPTION ["Background location-tracking is required"]` iOS

**[iOS (deprecated in 11.0)]** Customize the message displayed to the user when `Always` location authorization is requested.  This variable is added to your iOS `.plist` in the `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` key.

##### `@variable LOCATION_WHEN_IN_USE_USAGE_DESCRIPTION ["Background location-tracking is required"` iOS

**[iOS (deprecated in 11.0)]** Customize the message displayed to the user when `WhenInUse` location authorization is requested.  This variable is added to your iOS `.plist` in the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key.

##### `@variable MOTION_USAGE_DESCRIPTION ["Using the accelerometer increases battery-efficiency by..."` iOS

**[iOS]** Customize the message displayed to the user when "Motion & Fitness" permission is requested.  The plugin is **highly** optimized to use iOS `CMMotionActivityManager` API for intelligently toggling location-services only when the plugin is detected to be moving.

##### `@variable BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION ["&lt;string&gt;location&lt;/string&gt;"]` iOS
**[iOS]** Adds the iOS background-mode `location` to your iOS `.plist` file.  This is the default behaviour.  To disable this, (ie: for those using `useSignificantChangesOnly`), provide an empty-string:

```xml
  <variable name="BACKGROUND_MODE_LOCATION" value="" />
```

**WARNING** If you *do* want the default behaviour of background-location updates, simply **IGNORE** this variable -- Do **NOT** even provide it.  If you *do* provide it, you must provide the full escaped XML value of `&lt;string&gt;location&lt;/string&gt;` (the default value when not provided), not just `location`.


## :large_blue_diamond: Using the Plugin

The plugin creates the object **`window.BackgroundGeolocation`**.  See [API Documentation](docs) for details

### Ionic 2 and Typescript

[Sample Implementation](https://gist.github.com/christocracy/2abf5587cc12b83e15aa12958de7a7d2)

```javascript
platform.ready().then(() => {
  var bgGeo = (<any>window).BackgroundGeolocation;
});

```

### `#configure` the Plugin
There are **three** simple steps to using `BackgroundGeolocation`:

1. Listen to events
2. `#configure` the plugin
3. `#start` the plugin

```javascript
// 1.  Listen to events
bgGeo.on('location', onLocation, onLocationFailure);
bgGeo.on('motionchange', onMotionChange);
bgGeo.on('providerchange', onProviderChange);

// 2. Configure the plugin.  
bgGeo.configure({
  desiredAccuracy: 0,   // <-- Config params
  distanceFilter: 50
}, function(state) {    // <-- Current state provided to #configure callback
  // 3.  Start tracking
  console.log('BackgroundGeolocation is configured and ready to use');
  if (!state.enabled) {
    bgGeo.start(function() {
      console.log('- BackgroundGeolocation tracking started');
    });
  }
});
// NOTE:  Do NOT execute any API methods until the callback to #configure
// method above executes!
// For example, do not do this here:
// bgGeo.getCurrentPosition()   // <-- NO!
// bgGeo.getState();            // <-- NO!
```

:warning: Do not execute *any* API method (aside from `#getState` or adding event-listeners with `#on`) *before* the `callbackFn` to the `#configure` method fires, as noted above.

## :large_blue_diamond: Example

```javascript

////
// As with all Cordova plugins, you must configure within an #deviceready callback.
//
function onDeviceReady() {
    // Get a reference to the plugin.
    var bgGeo = window.BackgroundGeolocation;

    //This callback will be executed every time a geolocation is recorded in the background.
    var callbackFn = function(location, taskId) {
        var coords = location.coords;
        var lat    = coords.latitude;
        var lng    = coords.longitude;
        console.log('- Location: ', JSON.stringify(location));

        // Must signal completion of your callbackFn.
        bgGeo.finish(taskId);
    };

    // This callback will be executed if a location-error occurs.  Eg: this will be called if user disables location-services.
    var failureFn = function(errorCode) {
        console.warn('- BackgroundGeoLocation error: ', errorCode);
    }

    // Listen to location events & errors.
    bgGeo.on('location', callbackFn, failureFn);
    // Fired whenever state changes from moving->stationary or vice-versa.
    bgGeo.on('motionchange', function(isMoving) {
      console.log('- onMotionChange: ', isMoving);
    });
    // Fired whenever a geofence transition occurs.
    bgGeo.on('geofence', function(geofence) {
      console.log('- onGeofence: ', geofence.identifier, geofence.location);
    });
    // Fired whenever an HTTP response is received from your server.
    bgGeo.on('http', function(response) {
      console.log('http success: ', response.responseText);
    }, function(response) {
      console.log('http failure: ', response.status);
    });

    // BackgroundGeoLocation is highly configurable.
    bgGeo.configure({
        // Geolocation config
        desiredAccuracy: 0,
        distanceFilter: 10,
        stationaryRadius: 25,
        // Activity Recognition config
        activityRecognitionInterval: 10000,
        stopTimeout: 5,
        // Application config
        debug: true,  // <-- Debug sounds & notifications.
        stopOnTerminate: false,
        startOnBoot: true,
        // HTTP / SQLite config
        url: "http://your.server.com/locations",
        method: "POST",
        autoSync: true,
        maxDaysToPersist: 3,
        headers: {  // <-- Optional HTTP headers
            "X-FOO": "bar"
        },
        params: {   // <-- Optional HTTP params
            "auth_token": "maybe_your_server_authenticates_via_token_YES?"
        }
    }, function(state) {
        // This callback is executed when the plugin is ready to use.
        console.log("BackgroundGeolocation ready: ", state);
        if (!state.enabled) {
            bgGeo.start();
        }
    });

    // The plugin is typically toggled with some button on your UI.
    function onToggleEnabled(value) {
        if (value) {
            bgGeo.start();
        } else {
            bgGeo.stop();
        }
    }
}

```
